# Calculator using React

Creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves designing the user interface with HTML, styling it with CSS, and adding functionality with JavaScript. Here's a simple description of how each part works:
HTML (Structure)
The HTML part of the calculator defines the structure of the page.
It consists of a container with buttons for numbers (0-9), basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=) to calculate the result.
An input field or display area is included to show the current calculation or result.

CSS (Style)
The CSS is used to style the calculator, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
It can style buttons, the input field, and layout, including colors, padding, margins, and fonts.
Flexbox or grid layout can be used to arrange buttons in rows and columns.

JavaScript (Functionality)
The JavaScript part handles the logic for calculations.
Event listeners are added to buttons so that when a user clicks a button, the corresponding action (number, operator, or calculation) is triggered.
The JavaScript function will manage the input string, perform the calculation when "=" is clicked, and display the result in the input field.
A clear function (C button) will reset the input field to start a new calculation.
